# 🧪 Test Cases (Sprint 2)

The following section presents the 12 test cases designed for Sprint 2 of the Banking QA Application project.  
All cases were derived from the equivalence classes established in Sprint 1, ensuring broad and systematic coverage across valid, invalid, and boundary input conditions.

The banking application requires validation of the following fields:
- Bank Code  
- Branch Code  
- Account Number  
- Personal Key  
- Order Value  

Each test case includes:
- A unique Test Case ID  
- A concise scenario description  
- Input values for all required fields  
- The corresponding equivalence class alignment  
- The expected system behavior  
- The initial and final application state  

These test cases collectively validate normal operation, error handling under malformed data, boundary limits, and multi-error scenarios.  
They also establish the foundation for automated verification through the Java simulation implemented in Sprint 3.

12 test cases include:

- ID  
- Description  
- Input values  
- Equivalence class alignment  
- Expected result  
- Initial and final state  

Excel file located at `/docs/sprint2/12_Test_Cases.xlsx`.

This document lists the 12 test cases designed from the defined equivalence classes.

## Conclusions

The completion of Sprint 2 resulted in the creation of 12 fully detailed test cases, each derived directly from the equivalence classes defined in Sprint 1. This sprint marks the transition from theoretical test modeling to practical, structured QA documentation.

### Key Outcomes
- All test cases map to at least one valid or invalid equivalence class, ensuring systematic and complete coverage.  
- The test suite includes scenarios with simple errors, multi-field errors, boundary cases, and fully valid inputs, reflecting realistic banking system behaviors.  
- Each case documents inputs, expected results, and both initial and final system states, ensuring full traceability.  
- The Excel file includes a dedicated “Equivalence Class Alignment” column for improved clarity and auditability.  
- These 12 cases form the baseline for automated input validation during the Java simulation in Sprint 3.

### What Was Learned
- Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP) significantly reduces the number of required test cases while preserving test coverage.  
- Banking input fields require strict validation to prevent operational, transactional, and security issues.  
- Multi-error scenarios highlight the importance of compound error handling in financial applications.  
- Boundary values, even when valid, must be tested to ensure stability and prevent unexpected system behavior.

### Preparedness for Sprint 3
The test cases developed in Sprint 2 will be used directly within the Java simulation to validate:
- Successful workflows with valid data  
- Error responses generated under invalid inputs  
- System behavior when handling boundary conditions  

Sprint 2 provides a complete and solid test foundation, enabling Sprint 3 to be implemented accurately and efficiently.

## Sprint 3 — Test Case Execution

This section documents how the Sprint 3 test cases were executed and the successful outcomes.

- Execution environment: Windows PowerShell, JDK 11+, Maven 3.x.
- Commands used:
	- Run unit tests: `mvn test`
	- Run simulation: `mvn compile exec:java`

- Executed cases (examples saved in `BankingQAApplication/evidence/execution_results.txt`):
	1. TC01 — Valid checkbook request
		 - Input: `bankCode=123`, `branchCode=1023`, `accountNumber=9876543210`, `personalKey=445566`, `orderValue=1`
		 - Expected: Accepted (no validation errors)
		 - Result: Accepted — "RESULT: VÁLIDO"

	2. TC05/TC03 mix — Invalid multi-field request
		 - Input: `bankCode=12` (too short), `branchCode=1A33` (non-numeric), `accountNumber=A234567890` (letters), `personalKey=123` (too short), `orderValue=3` (unsupported)
		 - Expected: Rejected with field-specific error messages
		 - Result: Rejected — errors returned for bank code, branch code, account number, personal key, order value

	3. TC10 — Boundary case (zeros)
		 - Input: `bankCode=000`, `branchCode=0000`, `accountNumber=0000000000`, `personalKey=000000`, `orderValue=1`
		 - Expected: Accepted if zeros meet length and numeric rules
		 - Result: Accepted — "RESULT: VÁLIDO"

- How the cases were executed:
	1. Tests: The 12 designed cases (TC01–TC12) were encoded as a JUnit 5 parameterized test (`@MethodSource`) in `BankRequestValidatorTest`. Running `mvn test` executed them as black-box checks (input → expected validity). All 12 tests passed.
	2. Simulation: `BankSimulation` contains a small `main` that builds three representative `BankRequest` instances (valid, invalid, boundary) and prints the `ValidationResult`. Running `mvn compile exec:java` produced console output which was captured and saved to `BankingQAApplication/evidence/execution_results.txt`.

- Evidence and artifacts:
	- `BankingQAApplication/evidence/execution_results.txt` — console output showing simulation results and detected validation messages.
	- `BankingQAApplication/pom.xml` — Maven project file used to run tests and simulation.
	- Source files: `BankingQAApplication/src/main/java/com/techready/banking/**` and tests in `BankingQAApplication/src/test/java/com/techready/banking/test/`.

Summary: The Sprint 3 simulation validates the equivalence-class based test cases in an automated, repeatable way. The three representative runs verify successful acceptance of valid and boundary inputs and correct rejection with detailed error messages for invalid inputs.

# 🌱 Sustainability 

## 1. Technical Sustainability
The project promotes long-term maintainability and software quality by documenting the entire testing workflow and validating banking input data through structured methodologies.  
Using **equivalence class partitioning**, reusable test cases, and a **Java-based input validation simulation** ensures that the system remains stable, scalable, and easy to update as requirements evolve.

**Key contributions:**
- Reusable validation logic that can be integrated into backend services.  
- Standardized documentation (PDF + Excel) that improves knowledge transfer.  
- Automated validation that reduces regression risks and repeated manual checks.

---

## 2. Economic Sustainability
This project increases the banking institution’s operational efficiency by reducing the cost of:
- Manual validation of user information  
- Handling user errors and failed transactions  
- Customer service tickets due to incorrect data entry  
- Operational risks associated with inconsistent or faulty inputs  

Automation ensures long-term savings and reduces dependencies on manual review processes.

---

## 3. Social Sustainability
Improved input validation contributes to:
- More secure and reliable online banking experiences  
- Greater accessibility for users with limited technical skills  
- Increased trust in financial digital services  
- Error-prevention mechanisms that protect vulnerable users from mistakes  

A reliable online platform strengthens the institution’s social responsibility and customer satisfaction.

---

## 4. Environmental Sustainability
While the project is software-based, strong digital infrastructure indirectly supports environmental goals by:
- Reducing unnecessary branch visits  
- Lowering energy use associated with error correction or repeated transactions  
- Minimizing paper-based statements through correct digital submissions  

Better validation → fewer mistakes → fewer resource-consuming interventions.
